This directory contains tools and instructions
to derive Jet Energy Scale Corrections
for the jets used in the High-Level Trigger (HLT).

#### Setup


Instructions to set up the CMSSW area to produce JRA NTuples, and derive JESCs can be found in the [`JMETriggerAnalysis` repository](https://github.com/sparedes/JMETriggerAnalysis/blob/run3_12_3_X/JESCorrections/readme.md)
